Duck Launcher
========

Duck Launcher is an application launcher and a dock made for linux. 
It's supposed to be beautiful while being useful. With the Duck Launcher, all your basic needs are pleased in one place:
  -Launch your apps
-------
  You can access your favorite apps easily on the dock, or you can find all your apps simply by clicking on the top icon.
  -Browse your files
---------
  [Work in progress]
  You will be able to access your files easily, without having to open the file manager each time.
 -Star
--------
  "Star" is kind of an extension of the file browser and the app launcher: you can choose any application, file or folder   and add it. But these can be separated in blocks. Let's say you're a graphic artist, then you'll add a block named       "Graphics" and add a few apps, like blender and gimp, and a folder where you store your files, and perhaps a file your     working on right know.
  -Customize Duck Launcher
-------
  With the duck settings, you can customize a lot of things, like your dock apps, the launcher's color, etc...
