duck-launcher (0.64.5-trusty1) trusty; urgency=high

  *Too many improvements:
   -New options to close,sleep,logout,etc..
   -Config file changed to json: quicker and easier
   -Change the font in the config file
   -File browser: different icons for music,videos,etc.. and you can see images
   -Ui for apps a bit improved
   -If there's only one app in search, press enter and it launches it.
   -Bug fixes...I guess
